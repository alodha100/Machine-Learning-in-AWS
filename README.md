## Case 1 Population Segmentation with SageMaker

Using principal component analysis (PCA) you will reduce the dimensionality of the original census data. Then, you'll use k-means clustering to assign each US county to a particular cluster based on where a county lies in component space. 

How each cluster is arranged in component space can tell you which US counties are most similar and what demographic traits define that similarity; this information is most often used to inform targeted, marketing campaigns that want to appeal to a specific group of people. This cluster information is also useful for learning more about a population by revealing patterns between regions that you otherwise may not have noticed.
